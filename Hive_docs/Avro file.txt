Avro file


Apache Avro is a data serialization system. Avro provides:

Rich data structures.

A compact, fast, binary data format.

A container file, to store persistent data.

Remote procedure call (RPC).

Simple integration with dynamic languages. Code generation is not required to read or write data files nor to use or implement RPC protocols. 

Code generation as an optional optimization, only worth implementing for statically typed languages.

The Avro data source supports:

Schema conversion: Automatic conversion between Apache Spark SQL and Avro records.

Partitioning: Easily reading and writing partitioned data without any extra configuration.

Compression: Compression to use when writing Avro out to disk. The supported types are uncompressed, snappy, and deflate. You can also specify the deflate level.

Record names: Record name and namespace by passing a map of parameters with recordName and recordNamespace
